## Projects

### Using Hypothesis Tests to Compare Advertising Methods 

[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/CJTAYL/ab_testing)

The purpose of the project was to conduct an independent t-test to evaluate the effects of a proposed advertising campaign. The results of the test indidicated a statistically significant difference between the consumers exposed to the current and proposed campaigns. Specifically, consumers exposed to the proposed advertising campaign spent more total dollars compared to consumers exposed to the current advertising campaign. 

<ins>Methods & Tools</ins>: Python, SciPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy, Seaborn, and Statsmodels

### Comparison of Methods to Inform K-Means 

[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/CJTAYL/kmeans_comparison)

The purpose of the project was to compare k-means clustering informed by an elbow plot and silhouette score. The implementations were evaluated using internal and external metrics. The results of the project indicated that k-means clustering informed by silhouette score performed better on the internal metrics and k-means clustering informed by an elbow plot performed better on the external metrics. 

<ins>Methods & Tools</ins>: K-Means Clustering, Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy, Scipy, and Seaborn

### Comparison of Machine Learning Models to Detect Heart Disease 

[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/CJTAYL/heart_disease)

Four machine learning algorithms were used to predict heart disease in a set of patients. The algorithms used were (a) Logistic regression, (b) Random forest, (d) Support-vector machine, and (e) k-Nearest neighbor. The models were evaluated using accuracy, sensitivity, F1 score, and Area Under the Curve - Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUC-ROC). The results of the project indicated that logistic regression was the best performing algorithm.

<ins>Methods & Tools</ins>: Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Support-Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor, Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Math, and Numpy

### Web App to Screen for Diabetes 

[Shiny App](https://shorturl.at/ntxVX) 

Designed and built web app to predict the probability of a person having diabetes based on sex, age, presence of hypertension, history of heart disease, body mass index, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level. 

<ins>Methods & Tools</ins>: Logistic Regression, R, and Shiny
