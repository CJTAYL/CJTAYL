## Projects
**Comparison of Methods to Inform K-Means** [GitHub](https://github.com/CJTAYL/kmeans_comparison)

This project compared k-means clustering informed by an elbow plot and silhouette score when organizing data from the Seeds dataset in the University of California at Irvine's Machine Learning Repository.

The code from this project was used to create a [tutorial](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/comparison-of-methods-to-inform-k-means-clustering-a830cdc8db50) that was published in Towards Data Science.

**Predicting Life Expectancy with Elastic-Net Regression** (Coming soon)

**Comparison of Machine Learning Models to Detect Heart Disease** (Coming soon)
